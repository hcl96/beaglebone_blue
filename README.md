BeagleBone Blue Projects
==========

1. EduMIP Balance: As part of MAE Embedded Controls class (144), dynamics of inverted mobile pendulum is analyzed and a controller developed. The control strategy is implemented in C and tested. Robot has achieved balance.

2. Monocopter Flight Controller: As part of MAE Senior Design (155B), a Linux-based computer is implemented to increase computational performance over the Arduino-based flight computer. This enables real-time system monitoring, controls experimentation. Flight software test completed.

Above projects utilized the RoboticsCape library developed by James Strawson.
